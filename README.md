# Discord AI Dungeon Master

A Discord bot that runs a shared D&D 5e (2014 RAW) campaign using OpenAI.
Campaign memory lives in PostgreSQL. It uses versioned shared checkpoints
with timelines, so a rollback leaves the abandoned events stored but no
longer used as canon.

## Setup

1. Node.js 20+ and a PostgreSQL database.
2. `npm install`
3. `cp .env.example .env` and fill in the values.
4. `npm run migrate` to create or update the schema (see [Database](#database)).
5. `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for watch mode).

## Usage

Mention the bot (or the DM role) in an allowed channel. Only Discord
users registered in `campaign_players` get an answer. The bot handles
one request per server at a time; anyone who asks in the meantime is
told to retry.

- **#main-adventure**: the shared story. History before the checkpoint
  boundary is replaced by the checkpoint.
- **Private player channels**: only the owning player can talk to the DM there.
- **#dm-testing**: diagnostics only. Nothing is persisted and checkpoint
  commands are read-only.

### Checkpoint commands

Run these in #main-adventure (`show` and `versions` also work in #dm-testing):

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/checkpoint show` | Show the active checkpoint |
| `/checkpoint versions` | List the last 20 versions |
| `/checkpoint save` | Draft a new checkpoint from recent main-adventure history |
| `/checkpoint confirm` | Promote your draft to the active checkpoint |
| `/checkpoint cancel` | Discard your draft |
| `/checkpoint rollback <n>` | Restore version `n` on a new timeline |

```

Dependencies only point downward: `discord` → `services` → `db` / `ai`.

## Database

Schema changes live in [`migrations/`](migrations/) as numbered SQL
files (`0001_baseline.sql`, `0002_...`). Applied migrations are recorded
in the `schema_migrations` table.

```bash
npm run migrate -- status   # list pending migrations
npm run migrate             # apply them, each in its own transaction
```

- The bot refuses to start while migrations are pending. It never runs
  them on its own.
- Migrations only move forward. To undo one, write a new migration that
  reverses it, and take a `pg_dump` backup before any migration that
  changes data.
- Run migrations as `dnd_bot`, the role that owns the tables, so no extra
  `GRANT`s are needed.
- `0001_baseline.sql` reproduces the schema from before migrations were
  tracked. On an existing database it changes nothing and is only
  recorded as applied.

Startup also requires that `campaign_players` contains both Kraavok and
Looming Shade.

## Caveats

- No Avrae result ingestion yet.
- Private-channel checkpoints are not implemented. Private channels use
  their full active-timeline history.
- No usage or budget accounting.
- Treat model output as narrative, not as proof that data isolation has
  been audited.
